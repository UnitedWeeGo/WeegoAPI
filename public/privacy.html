	<h1>Weego Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p>UnitedWego, LLC. ("<b>Weego</b>") knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By visiting Weego's Website at <a href="http://www.unitedweego.com">http://www.unitedweego.com</a> (the "<b>Website</b>"), or using any of our services (collectively, the Website and all services are the "<b>Service</b>"), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
	<h2>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h2>
	<p>This Privacy Policy covers Weego's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Weego gathers when you are accessing the Service. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Weego does not own or control, or to individuals that Weego does not employ or manage</p>
	<h2>What Personal Information Does Weego display or Collect?</h2>
	<p>The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our Service, and to allow our users to set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with other users through the Service. In connection with the Service, we request and display some personal information to other users and visitors of the Service, which allows users to identify each other. We collect the following types of information from our users.</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Personal Information You Provide to Us:</b> We receive and store any information you enter on the Service or provide to us in any other way, and we use your personally identifiable, registration, profile, and location information to operate, maintain, and provide to you and other users all of the features and functionality of the Service.  Examples of the types of Personal Information collected when you enter it include your name, age, e-mail address, phone number, third party service ID (such as Facebook ID, OAuth credentials, etc.),  You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features. The Personal Information you provide is used for purposes such as responding to your requests for certain information, providing you with our products and services, customizing the content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features. You may modify or remove any the personal information you entered at any time by emailing a request to  <a href="mailto:help@unitedweego.com">help@unitedweego.com</a>.</li>
	<li><b>Personal Information Collected Automatically:</b> We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Service and our services. Weego automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Weego cookie information, and the page you requested. We also record the details of your transactions on the Service and in the Service.  For end users, Weego automatically records all messages viewed and sent via the Service, the type of mobile device upon which it was viewed, the OS and language of the device, the time of the transaction, the location of the device (if available), and all content entered in the course of the transaction.</li>
	<li>Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Service, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Weego only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of the Service so that we can make the Service appealing to as many users as possible, and improve it. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and the Service, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience.</li>
	<li><b>E-mail Communications:</b> We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Weego if your computer supports this type of program. Weego uses this confirmation to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful.  If you do not wish to receive emails from Weego, you can opt out of them via the Service.</li>
	<li><b>Cookies:</b> Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive or your mobile device's storage area through your browser or the applicable mobile application to enable our systems to recognize your browser or mobile device and tell us how and when our Service is visited. Weego cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.</li>
	<li>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of the Service's most attractive features.</li>
	<li>Ads that may appear on the Service may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computing device each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computing device (computer, mobile phone, touchpad device, etc.). This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. You may find out additional information regarding the use of cookies by our advertising partners, including how to opt out of the use of such technologies, at www.networkadvertising.org. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Weego and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</li>
