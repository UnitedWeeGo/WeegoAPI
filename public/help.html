	<h1>What is Weego?</h1>
	<p>Weego is a group collaboration application that enables you and your friends to plan & decide, as a group, where to go.</p>
	<h1>Why Weego?</h1>
	<p>We created Weego to alleviate the tedium of planning and deciding outings with our friends. Hopefully you will find this service useful in planning and deciding where you go with your friends!</p>
	<h1>How do I get started?</h1>
	<p>Using the iPhone application, create an event by selecting the “+” button. Add some of your friends and the places you would like to go to. And your friends can do the same. Everyone picks the place(s) they would like to “Go” to. Then Weego will let the group know the group’s decision, including the event time and location.</p>
	<h1>When can my friends see my current location?</h1>
	<p>Right around the start time of the event Weego will let your group know where you are. And when you arrive at the location, Weego will automatically check you in and let everyone know that you have arrived.
	<br />
	<br />
	*Only people that you and your friends have invited can access the events data.</p>
	<h1>Can I disable sharing my current location?</h1>
	<p>Yes. Within the “Settings” view of the application you can disable sharing your cuurent location by toggling the “Display my location” to “OFF”.</p>
	<h1>What Apple devices are supported?</h1>
	<p>We support iPhone 3GS &amp; iPhone 4 running iOS 4.3 or later.</p>
	<h1>I don't have an iPhone. Can I still use Weego?</h1>
	<p>No. Unfortunately this first release only supports iPhone 3GS &amp; iPhone 4 running iOS 4.3 or later. In the very near future you will be able to access the service from any mobile or desktop browser.</p>
	<h1>Will you support other smart phones?</h1>
	<p>Yes. We’re planning to release a version that will be accessible through any mobile browser. We’re also planning to release an Android version in the coming months.</p>
	<h1>Help, my push notifications are broken!</h1>
	<p>First, check to make sure you have enabled push notifications in your phone's Settings for Weego. Second, try logging out and back in to the application. Note that Apple's push notifications are not 100% reliable. If you are in an area of bad or sporadic coverage, you may occasionally miss notifications. In these cases, you can manually check for new updates by using pull-to-refresh on your events dashboard.</p>
